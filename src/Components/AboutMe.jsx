            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              I was born in Libya and moved to Canada in 2008. Prior to that, I
              lived in Malaysia from 2001 to 2004. I am a social person that
              loves to meet new people and make new friends. I am also an
              enthusiastic individual who loves exploring new interests. I am an
              active person who enjoys playing sports, hiking, and
              weightlifting. My competitive spirit drives me to setting
              ambitious goals and working diligently to achieve them. I am
              passionate about making a positive impact on the world and take
              great joy in helping others and giving back to my community.
              Overall, I strive to lead a fulfilling life while making
              meaningful contributions to those around me.

            <h2>Personal Qualities and Values</h2>
            <p>
              Creativity, curiosity, and determination are at the core of who I
              am. I express myself through various forms of art and I
              continuously seek to learn and explore new ideas. I approach
              challenges with a disciplined and enthusiastic mindset, constantly
              striving to be the best version of myself. Due to my friendly and
              caring nature, I value being a supportive and understanding
              presence for others. I am committed to giving back to my community
              and helping those in need. Honesty and humility are central to my
              character and guide me in making thoughtful decisions and building
              strong and loyal relationships. Versatility and wisdom are traits
              I embrace as I navigate through life's various experiences, always
              learning and growing.
