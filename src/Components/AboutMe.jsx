            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
              I was born in Libya and moved to Canada in 2008. Prior to that, I
              lived in Malaysia from 2001 to 2004. I am a social person that
              loves to meet new people and make new friends. I am also an
              enthusiastic individual who loves exploring new interests.
              Overall, I strive to lead a fulfilling life while making
              meaningful contributions to my community and those around me.

            <h2>Personal Qualities and Values</h2>
            <p>
              Creativity, curiosity, and determination are at the core of who I
              am, constantly driving me to be the best version of myself. I
              express myself through various forms of art and I continuously
              seek to learn and explore new ideas. Honesty and humility are
              central to my character and guide me in making thoughtful
              decisions and building strong and loyal relationships. Versatility
              and wisdom are traits I embrace as I navigate through life's
              various experiences, always learning and growing.
